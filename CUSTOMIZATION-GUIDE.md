# Customization Guide

Make these skills yours in 5 minutes.

## Quick Setup

Most skills work immediately. But they're better when personalized.

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```bash
/personalize-skills
```

This walks you through each placeholder and updates all files automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# See all placeholders
grep -r "\[YOUR_" ~/.claude/skills/

# Edit each file as needed
```

---

## All Placeholders

*This section will be populated after skills are synced.*

| Placeholder | Skills | Description | Example |
|-------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `[YOUR_NAME]` | coach, writeup | Your name | Danny |
| `[YOUR_EMAIL]` | inbox-commander | Your email address | you@company.com |
| `[YOUR_CLOUD_PATH]` | writeup | Cloud storage path | ~/Dropbox/ |

---

## By Skill

*Detailed per-skill customization will be added after sync.*

---

## Graceful Degradation

Skills are designed to work even without customization:

| Placeholder | If Not Set |
|-------------|------------|
| `[YOUR_NAME]` | Uses "you" instead |
| `[YOUR_EMAIL]` | Asks when needed |
| `[YOUR_CLOUD_PATH]` | Outputs to conversation instead |

You can always add customization later.
