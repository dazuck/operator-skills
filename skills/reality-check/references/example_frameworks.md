# Example Review Frameworks

> **IMPORTANT**: These are EXAMPLES ONLY. Every piece of work is unique. Use these frameworks as inspiration or starting points, but always adapt dynamically to the specific context, domain, and constraints of the work being reviewed. The best feedback comes from understanding the unique situation, not applying rigid templates.

## Strategic Plan Assessment Matrix

### Completeness Check

- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Defined success metrics
- [ ] Timeline with milestones
- [ ] Resource allocation
- [ ] Risk mitigation plan
- [ ] Stakeholder mapping
- [ ] Communication plan
- [ ] Success/failure criteria

### Coherence Test

- Does each tactic ladder to a strategy?
- Does each strategy support a goal?
- Are dependencies explicitly mapped?
- Do timelines account for all dependencies?

### Feasibility Analysis

- Resource availability vs. requirements
- Team capability vs. task complexity
- Timeline realism given constraints
- Political/organizational feasibility

## Content Quality Framework

### Structure Assessment

1. **Hook effectiveness** - Does opening grab attention?
2. **Flow logic** - Can reader follow without effort?
3. **Information hierarchy** - Most important first?
4. **Transition quality** - Smooth connections between sections?
5. **Conclusion impact** - Clear takeaway and next steps?

### Message Clarity

- One-sentence summary possible?
- Key points identifiable within 30 seconds?
- Supporting evidence present and relevant?
- Counter-arguments addressed?

### Audience Alignment

- Language matches audience expertise
- Examples resonate with audience context
- Tone appropriate for relationship/stakes
- Cultural considerations addressed

## Technical Design Review

### Architecture Soundness

- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Interface boundaries clear
- Data flow documented
- Error handling comprehensive

### Scalability Factors

- Performance at 10x load
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy
- Service dependencies
- Failure cascade prevention

### Operational Readiness

- Monitoring/alerting plan
- Deployment process
- Rollback capability
- Documentation completeness
- Team knowledge transfer

## Communication Effectiveness

### Stakeholder Perspective Matrix

| Stakeholder    | What They Care About     | Potential Concerns         | Success Looks Like    |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Executive      | ROI, Risk, Timeline      | Cost overrun, delays       | Clear business impact |
| User           | Experience, Value        | Learning curve, disruption | Immediate benefit     |
| Technical Team | Feasibility, Maintenance | Technical debt, complexity | Clean implementation  |
| Support Team   | Documentaion, Training   | Increase in tickets        | Smooth transition     |

### Message Testing Questions

1. Would a newcomer understand this?
2. Does it answer "why should I care?"
3. Are next steps crystal clear?
4. Could someone argue against this effectively?
5. Does it anticipate likely questions?

## Gap Detection Patterns

### Common Missing Elements

**In Strategies:**

- Success metrics definition
- Failure mode analysis
- Resource requirements
- Timeline dependencies
- Stakeholder buy-in plan

**In Technical Specs:**

- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Migration path

**In Communications:**

- Context for newcomers
- Why now?
- What's different this time?
- Impact if we don't act
- Clear ask/CTA

**In Processes:**

- Handoff points
- Escalation paths
- Feedback loops
- Quality gates
- Documentation requirements

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

1. **Technical** - Can we build it?
2. **Operational** - Can we run it?
3. **Market** - Will anyone want it?
4. **Organizational** - Can we sustain it?
5. **Regulatory** - Is it compliant?

### Risk Severity Matrix

| Likelihood → <br> Impact ↓ | Low  | Medium   | High     |
| -------------------------- | ---- | -------- | -------- |
| **High**                   | Flag | Critical | Critical |
| **Medium**                 | Note | Flag     | Critical |
| **Low**                    | OK   | Note     | Flag     |

## Improvement Prioritization

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix

```
High Impact, Low Effort = DO FIRST
High Impact, High Effort = PLAN FOR
Low Impact, Low Effort = QUICK WINS
Low Impact, High Effort = SKIP
```

### Feedback Prioritization Rules

1. **Critical** - Blocks progress or causes failure
2. **Important** - Significantly improves outcome
3. **Nice-to-have** - Polish and optimization
4. **Skip** - Marginal improvement for high effort
