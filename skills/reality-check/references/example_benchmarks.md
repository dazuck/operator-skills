# Example Quality Benchmarks

> **IMPORTANT**: Quality standards are highly contextual. These examples illustrate possible excellence criteria, but every organization, team, and project has unique standards. Always calibrate to the specific context: startup vs. enterprise, internal vs. external, prototype vs. production. The best benchmark is what moves this specific work toward its specific goals within its specific constraints.

## Quick Quality Checks

### The 30-Second Test

Can someone understand:

- What this is about?
- Why it matters?
- What they need to do?

### The Outsider Test

Would someone new to the organization understand this without additional context?

What happens when:

- Volume increases 10x?
- Key person leaves?
- Requirements change?
- Timeline compressed?
- Budget cut?

### The Stakeholder Test

For each stakeholder:

- Is their concern addressed?
- Is the benefit clear?
- Do they know what's expected?
