# Mental Models Reference

> **Usage**: These are thinking tools, not checklists. Use the model that fits the situation. Often combining 2-3 models yields better insight than rigidly applying one.

## Decision-Making Models

### First Principles Thinking

Break down complex problems to fundamental truths, then rebuild.

- What do we know to be absolutely true?
- What are we assuming vs. what's proven?
- If we started from scratch, would we do it this way?

**Use when**: Conventional wisdom isn't working, entering unfamiliar territory, need to innovate.

### Inversion

Work backward from what you want to avoid.

- What would guarantee failure?
- What would make this situation worse?
- Avoid those things.

**Use when**: Direct path unclear, want to identify hidden risks, facing complex decisions.

### Second-Order Thinking

Consider the consequences of consequences.

- If we do X, then Y happens...
- And if Y happens, then Z follows...
- What's the full chain of effects?

**Use when**: Decisions with delayed feedback, policy changes, major strategic moves.

### Reversibility Test

How reversible is this decision?

- **Two-way doors** (reversible): Move fast, learn from doing
- **One-way doors** (irreversible): Slow down, gather more information

**Use when**: Deciding how much analysis a decision deserves.

### Opportunity Cost

What are you giving up by choosing this?

- Every yes is a no to something else
- What's the best alternative use of these resources?
- Is this the highest-value use of time/money/attention?

**Use when**: Resource allocation, prioritization, saying yes to new commitments.

## Strategy Models

### Porter's Five Forces

Understand competitive dynamics:

1. Rivalry among existing competitors
2. Threat of new entrants
3. Threat of substitutes
4. Bargaining power of suppliers
5. Bargaining power of buyers

**Use when**: Market analysis, competitive strategy, industry assessment.

### Jobs To Be Done

People don't buy products; they hire them to do a job.

- What job is the customer trying to get done?
- What are they firing to hire your solution?
- What progress are they trying to make in their lives?

**Use when**: Product strategy, understanding customer motivation, innovation.

### The Hedgehog Concept

Find the intersection of:

1. What you can be the best in the world at
2. What drives your economic engine
3. What you are deeply passionate about

**Use when**: Strategic focus, career decisions, organizational direction.

### Red Team / Pre-Mortem

Assume the plan failed. Now explain why.

- What went wrong?
- What did we miss?
- What would we do differently?

**Use when**: Before major initiatives, testing plans, identifying blind spots.

## People & Organization Models

### Delegation Levels

Match delegation style to situation and person:

1. **Tell**: Do exactly this
2. **Sell**: Do this because...
3. **Consult**: What do you think? (then decide)
4. **Participate**: Let's decide together
5. **Delegate**: You decide, keep me informed
6. **Empower**: You decide, no need to tell me

**Use when**: Assigning work, developing people, calibrating autonomy.

### Situational Leadership

Adapt style to competence + commitment:

- **High competence, high commitment** → Delegate
- **High competence, low commitment** → Support
- **Low competence, high commitment** → Coach
- **Low competence, low commitment** → Direct

**Use when**: Managing individuals, developing teams.

### RACI

Clarify roles:

- **Responsible**: Does the work
- **Accountable**: Has final authority (one person only)
- **Consulted**: Input before decision
- **Informed**: Told after decision

**Use when**: Project clarity, avoiding confusion, handoff planning.

### Radical Candor

Care personally + Challenge directly:

- **Radical Candor**: Care + Challenge (the goal)
- **Ruinous Empathy**: Care without Challenge (too nice)
- **Obnoxious Aggression**: Challenge without Care (abrasive)
- **Manipulative Insincerity**: Neither (worst)

**Use when**: Giving feedback, difficult conversations, building trust.

## Problem-Solving Models

### 5 Whys

Ask "why" five times to find root cause.

- Problem: X
- Why? → Because Y
- Why Y? → Because Z
- Continue until you hit bedrock

**Use when**: Root cause analysis, moving past symptoms to causes.

### Issue Trees / MECE

Break problems into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive parts.

- Each branch is distinct (no overlap)
- Together they cover everything (nothing missing)
- Enables systematic exploration

**Use when**: Complex problems, ensuring thorough analysis.

### The Eisenhower Matrix

Prioritize by urgency and importance:

- **Urgent + Important**: Do immediately
- **Important + Not Urgent**: Schedule time for this
- **Urgent + Not Important**: Delegate if possible
- **Neither**: Eliminate

**Use when**: Time management, prioritization, reducing reactive work.

### Cynefin Framework

Match approach to problem type:

- **Clear/Simple**: Best practice exists, follow it
- **Complicated**: Expertise needed, analyze then act
- **Complex**: Probe, sense, respond—emergence required
- **Chaotic**: Act immediately, then sense and respond
- **Confused**: Don't know which domain—clarify first

**Use when**: Choosing how to approach a problem, avoiding over/under-analysis.

## Communication Models

### Pyramid Principle

Lead with the answer, then support it.

1. Start with conclusion/recommendation
2. Group supporting arguments
3. Order logically
4. Support each argument with evidence

**Use when**: Executive communication, persuasion, clear writing.

### SBI Feedback Model

Structure feedback clearly:

- **Situation**: When and where
- **Behavior**: What specifically happened (observable)
- **Impact**: The effect of that behavior

**Use when**: Giving feedback, difficult conversations, coaching.

### Stakeholder Mapping

Understand who matters and how:

- **Power**: Can they enable or block?
- **Interest**: Do they care?
- **Position**: For, against, or neutral?

Strategy varies by quadrant (high power + interest = manage closely).

**Use when**: Change initiatives, influencing, navigating organizations.

## Learning Models

### Bloom's Taxonomy

Levels of cognitive engagement (ascending):

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

**Use when**: Designing learning, assessing depth of understanding.

### The Feynman Technique

To truly understand something:

1. Explain it simply (as if to a child)
2. Identify gaps where you struggle
3. Go back and learn those parts
4. Simplify further

**Use when**: Testing your own understanding, preparing to teach.

### Deliberate Practice

Improvement requires:

- Specific goals just beyond current ability
- Immediate feedback
- Focused repetition
- Willingness to be uncomfortable

**Use when**: Skill development, breaking plateaus.

## Systems Models

### Leverage Points

Where to intervene in systems (ascending power):

1. Constants, parameters, numbers
2. Regulating negative feedback loops
3. Driving positive feedback loops
4. Information flows
5. Rules of the system
6. Goals of the system
7. Mindset or paradigm of the system

**Use when**: Organizational change, systemic problems, policy design.

### Stock and Flow

Systems have stocks (accumulations) and flows (rates of change).

- Stocks change slowly; flows can change quickly
- Focus on what drives the flows to change the stocks

**Use when**: Understanding system dynamics, planning interventions.

### Local vs Global Optima

Local optimum: Best within constraints
Global optimum: Best overall

You can be stuck at a local optimum that requires getting worse before getting better.

**Use when**: Strategic decisions, recognizing when to accept short-term pain.
