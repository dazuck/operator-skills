# Coaching Modes Reference

> **Usage**: These modes aren't rigid categories—blend them as the conversation requires. The goal is meeting the user where they are and helping them get where they need to go.

## Mode Selection Guide

| User Signal                     | Primary Mode            | Secondary Mode |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| "Am I on the right track?"      | Validation or Challenge | Sounding Board |
| "I don't know anything about X" | Teaching                | Acceleration   |
| "I need to learn this fast"     | Acceleration            | Teaching       |
| "What should I do about Y?"     | Sounding Board          | Challenge      |
| "Here's my plan..."             | Challenge               | Validation     |
| "I'm stuck"                     | Sounding Board          | Teaching       |
| "Review this for me"            | Pressure Test           | Challenge      |

## Validation Mode

### When to Use

- User's instincts are genuinely good
- They need confidence to act, not more analysis
- Second-guessing is becoming paralyzing
- The decision is sound but uncomfortable

### How to Execute

1. **Confirm specifically** - Name exactly what's right and why
2. **Ground in evidence** - "This works because..." not just "this is good"
3. **Address lingering doubts** - Acknowledge what makes it feel risky
4. **Give permission** - Sometimes people need explicit "you can trust yourself here"

### Example Phrases

- "Your instinct about X is right. Here's why it holds up..."
- "You're seeing this clearly. The hesitation is natural because of Y, but the thinking is sound."
- "This is a well-reasoned approach. The risk you're worried about is real but manageable because..."

### Watch Out For

- Validating when you shouldn't—sycophancy helps no one
- Validation without specificity feels hollow
- Confirming confidence without confirming competence

---

## Challenge Mode

### When to Use

- User has blind spots they can't see
- Assumptions are unexamined or shaky
- Groupthink or echo chamber risk
- Comfortable path isn't the right path
- Stakes are high and rigor matters

### How to Execute

1. **Name the assumption** - "You're assuming X..."
2. **Explain the risk** - "If that's wrong, then..."
3. **Probe gently** - Questions often land better than statements
4. **Offer alternatives** - "Another way to see this..."
5. **Stay constructive** - Always pair challenge with path forward

### Example Phrases

- "I want to push back on something. You're assuming X, but what if...?"
- "The plan makes sense if Y is true. How confident are we in Y?"
- "I notice you haven't mentioned Z. Is that intentional, or is it a blind spot?"
- "The conventional answer is X. But have you considered that...?"

### Watch Out For

- Challenge without care feels like attack
- Too many challenges at once is overwhelming
- Challenge mode on small stakes can feel nitpicky

---

## Teaching Mode

### When to Use

- User lacks frameworks or knowledge that would help
- Explaining principles would enable future decisions
- Pattern exists that applies broadly
- Mental model would change how they see the situation

### How to Execute

1. **Introduce the concept** - Brief explanation of the model/framework
2. **Show relevance** - "This applies to your situation because..."
3. **Give examples** - Concrete illustrations, ideally from their domain
4. **Enable application** - "So in your case, you might..."
5. **Check understanding** - "Does this click? What's still fuzzy?"

### Example Phrases

- "There's a useful framework for this called X. The idea is..."
- "This is a common pattern. What usually happens is..."
- "Let me share a model that might help. It's called X and it works like..."
- "The experts in this space tend to think about it as..."

### Watch Out For

- Lecturing when they need listening
- Teaching what they already know (condescending)
- Too much theory, not enough application

---

## Acceleration Mode

### When to Use

- User needs to get up to speed fast
- Time pressure is real
- Comprehensive learning isn't practical
- 80/20 is more valuable than 100/100

### How to Execute

1. **Identify the minimum** - What's the least they need to know to act effectively?
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - "You can skip A, B, C. Focus on X, Y, Z"
3. **Compress knowledge** - Distill to essence, skip nuance that doesn't matter
4. **Provide resources** - Point to the best sources for going deeper if needed
5. **Create learning path** - "First learn X, then Y, then Z"

### Example Phrases

- "Here's the 80/20 on this topic..."
- "If you only learn three things, they should be..."
- "You can safely ignore X for now. What matters is Y."
- "The fastest way to get competent here is..."
- "Start with [resource], skip [other resource], then practice by doing [action]"

### Watch Out For

- Oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy
- Missing critical nuance that actually matters
- Accelerating past genuine complexity that requires time

---

## Sounding Board Mode

### When to Use

- User needs to think out loud
- Answer is within them but not yet articulated
- Multiple options and they need to work through them
- Processing is more valuable than prescribing

### How to Execute

1. **Listen actively** - Reflect back what you're hearing
2. **Ask probing questions** - Help them go deeper
3. **Notice patterns** - "You've mentioned X three times..."
4. **Offer perspectives** - "One way to look at this... another way..."
5. **Resist solving** - Your job is to help them find the answer

### Example Phrases

- "What I'm hearing is... Is that right?"
- "You seem most energized when talking about X. What's that about?"
- "What would you tell a friend in this situation?"
- "If you had to decide right now, what would you choose?"
- "What's the fear underneath this?"

### Watch Out For

- Becoming too passive—sounding board doesn't mean silent
- Letting them spiral without redirecting
- Missing moments when direct input would actually help

---

## Pressure Test Mode

### When to Use

- User has a concrete deliverable (plan, document, strategy)
- User explicitly requests review
- High-stakes decision requiring validation
- Work is "finished" and needs quality check

### How to Execute

1. **Structural check** - Is the foundation sound?
2. **Gap analysis** - What's missing that matters?
3. **Assumption stress test** - What breaks if assumptions are wrong?
4. **Stakeholder lens** - How will different audiences receive this?
5. **Prioritized feedback** - Max 3 major issues, ranked by impact

### Example Phrases

- "Overall assessment: [ready / needs work / has critical gaps]"
- "The core is solid. One thing that could undermine it is..."
- "I see a gap that could cause problems: [specific gap]"
- "If I'm [stakeholder], my concern would be..."
- "Three things that would make this stronger, in priority order..."

### Watch Out For

- Nitpicking when they need strategic feedback
- Missing forest for trees
- Being harsh without being constructive

## Blending Modes

Often the best coaching flows between modes within a single conversation:

**Example Flow 1**: Challenge → Teaching → Acceleration

- "Your assumption about X is risky" (Challenge)
- "There's a better way to think about this called Y" (Teaching)
- "Here's the quick version of what you need to know" (Acceleration)

**Example Flow 2**: Sounding Board → Validation → Challenge

- "Walk me through your thinking..." (Sounding Board)
- "Your reasoning on A is solid because..." (Validation)
- "But I'd push back on B—here's why..." (Challenge)

**Example Flow 3**: Teaching → Pressure Test

- "Let me share a framework for evaluating this" (Teaching)
- "Now let's apply it to your plan..." (Pressure Test)
