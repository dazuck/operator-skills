name: create-briefing
description: Create shareable briefing documents from sessions, research, or learnings. Use when asked to "create a briefing", "write up findings", "summarize this session", "create a proposal", or when synthesizing work into a document others can consume. Produces dual-audience docs with human-readable content up top and structured AI context at bottom.

# Create Briefing

Transform work sessions, research, or learnings into shareable briefing documents. Designed for the emerging pattern where documents need to serve both human readers and AI agents that will consume them later.

## Core Philosophy

**Dual-audience documents**: Every briefing has two sections:
1. **Human-readable top**: Clear, scannable, persuasive content for human readers
2. **AI context bottom**: Structured data, research findings, definitions, and source material that AI agents can draw on

This pattern is increasingly important as people use AI to read and summarize documents.

## When to Use

- End of a research or exploration session
- After significant decisions or debates
- When creating proposals for team review
- When synthesizing multiple sources into a single artifact
- When documenting learnings for future reference

## Invocation

`/briefing` — Assess session and recommend format
`/briefing proposal` — Create a proposal document
`/briefing summary` — Quick summary of session learnings
`/briefing research` — Research synthesis document
`/briefing [custom]` — Natural language guidance on format

## Process

### Step 1: Assess the Content

Before writing, understand:
- **What was accomplished**: Decisions, findings, builds, learnings
- **Who will read this**: Team, stakeholders, future-self, future-AI-agents
- **What's the goal**: Persuade, inform, document, propose, request decision
- **What artifacts exist**: Code, data, research, quotes, examples

### Step 2: Determine Format

Choose format based on **purpose** (what you're trying to accomplish):

#### Inform & Update

| Format | Best For | Length | When to Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Status Update** | Regular progress reports | 200-400 words | Weekly/periodic updates to stakeholders |
| **Executive Summary** | High-level overview for busy readers | 300-500 words | When execs need the gist without details |
| **Session Notes** | Capturing learnings from a work session | 200-500 words | End of research/exploration sessions |

#### Propose & Decide

| Format | Best For | Length | When to Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Proposal** | Pitching an idea, requesting approval | 800-2000 words | New initiatives, budget requests, strategy changes |
| **Decision Doc** | Structured decision with options | 500-1500 words | When multiple stakeholders need to align on a choice |
| **One-Pager** | Concise pitch or summary | 400-600 words | Quick executive read, meeting pre-read |
| **6-Pager** (Amazon-style) | Comprehensive narrative memo | 1500-2500 words | Major initiatives requiring deep thinking |

#### Technical & Engineering

| Format | Best For | Length | When to Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **RFC / Design Doc** | Technical proposals seeking feedback | 1000-3000 words | Architecture decisions, new systems, major changes |
| **Technical Briefing** | Explaining implementation approach | 500-1500 words | Onboarding, handoffs, knowledge transfer |
| **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) | Documenting a specific technical decision | 300-600 words | Recording why a particular approach was chosen |

#### Learn & Reflect

| Format | Best For | Length | When to Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Research Synthesis** | Consolidating investigation findings | 500-1500 words | After research phase, before action |
| **Post-Mortem / Retrospective** | Learning from incidents or projects | 500-1200 words | After incidents, project completion, failures |
| **Lessons Learned** | Capturing insights for future reference | 300-800 words | End of project phase, after experiments |

If format isn't clear from invocation, present 2-3 relevant options:
> "This could be a **[format A]** (if goal is X) or **[format B]** (if goal is Y). Which fits better?"

### Step 3: Extract Core Elements

Identify before drafting:

1. **The headline**: What's the single most important thing?
2. **The "so what"**: Why should the reader care?
3. **The evidence**: What supports the conclusions?
4. **The ask** (if any): What decision or action is needed?
5. **The open questions**: What's unresolved?

### Step 4: Draft the Document

Follow the dual-audience structure:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Summary
[2-4 sentences capturing the essence. A reader should understand the core message from this alone.]

---

## [Human-Readable Sections]

## Writing Principles

### For Human Readers

- **Lead with the headline**: Most important thing first
- **Make it scannable**: Headers, bullets, tables
- **Be direct**: State conclusions, then support them
- **Show, don't tell**: Use examples, data, artifacts
- **End with clarity**: Clear ask or next step

### For AI Consumers

The "Additional Context" section should:

- **Be structured**: Use consistent headers and formats
- **Include raw data**: Quotes, numbers, source material
- **Define terms**: Avoid ambiguity
- **Cite sources**: Links, references, attribution
- **Preserve reasoning**: How conclusions were reached

### General Quality

- **Honest**: Acknowledge uncertainty, present counterarguments
- **Concise**: Say it once clearly, not three times vaguely
- **Actionable**: Reader knows what to do after reading
- **Complete**: All context needed to understand and act

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering:

- [ ] Summary captures the essence in 2-4 sentences
- [ ] Human section is scannable and clear
- [ ] AI section has structured, consumable context
- [ ] Any ask or decision request is explicit
- [ ] Open questions are acknowledged
- [ ] File saved to appropriate location

## Example: What We Just Did

The proposal document we created earlier (`Time Delay Arbitrate - Asian news POC.md`) follows this pattern:

- **Human sections**: Summary, Sprint Plan, Bull/Bear Case
- **AI section**: "Additional Context (For AIs and Deep Dives)" with research findings, definitions, sources
- **Clear ask**: Decision requested with resource requirements

This dual-audience structure makes the document useful both for team review and for future AI agents who need to understand the context.
