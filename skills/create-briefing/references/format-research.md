## Dual-Audience Pattern

The "human-readable top, AI context bottom" pattern is emerging as AI agents increasingly consume documents. Key principles:

1. **Human section**: Scannable, conclusions first, clear ask
2. **AI section**: Structured data, raw sources, definitions, reasoning chain

This allows documents to serve both immediate human readers and future AI agents who need to understand context.
